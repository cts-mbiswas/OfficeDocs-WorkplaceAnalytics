# Check in and update OKRs periodically

Regular evaluation of your Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) helps you gauge the progress you're making toward your goals. You'll develop and document your OKRs at the beginning of an applicable time period, such as a quarter, and then conduct a reflection process at the end of that time period. During your reflection process, you'll score your progress with respect to your goals. However, it's also vital to evaluate your progress *during* the time period, to ensure you're on track to meeting your goals.

In this article, we'll discuss:

- How to define and describe the two types of check-ins you can do with Viva Goals. 
- Examples of the two types and when to use them.  
- The benefits of using data integrations for your check-in reviews. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Consistency is key with respect to doing check-ins. Focus on progress rather than perfection. If you miss a series of check-ins, don’t give up on the process. Instead, start doing your check-ins again and continue regularly through the rest of your OKR time period. 

## What is a check-in? 

Regular check-ins, where you update metrics to reflect where you're at, help you review and assess progress toward meeting your OKRs. You can conduct a check-in manually in Viva Goals or integrate it with an outside data source so check-ins occur automatically.  

## Check-in cadence 

The check-in process typically takes a few minutes, or you can automate it. We recommend a weekly check-in, which helps ensure that you're updating key metrics. Consistent check-ins provide a clear picture of your progress and help ensure you remain on track or make adjustments as necessary. However, you can select a different check-in cadence if you feel like a weekly review isn't necessary. 

## Manual vs. integrated check-ins 

You can update your OKR progress in Viva Goals either manually or by integrating it with a data source. 

### Manual check-ins

In most cases, it literally takes less than a minute to perform a manual check-in. It's important to note that when you check in manually, you must enter the latest value of the metric you're tracking. 

As an example, suppose you work for a content team and one of your key results is to increase customer-facing knowledge base articles from 25 to 100 articles during the current quarter. It's the first week of the quarter, and you've already published five new articles. To conduct a check-in with respect to this goal: 

1. Navigate to the applicable key result in Viva Goals, and then select **Check-in**. 
1. Change the metric from **25** to **30**, and then add a comment such as “Great progress this week with five new articles.”
1. Select **Check-in** to save your update, and that's it. You're done checking in. Viva Goals will update your progress and status, and display your check-in note so others can review it. 

### Integrated check-ins

When you integrate Viva Goals with a data source such as Azure DevOps or Microsoft Excel, or a collaboration platform such as Microsoft Teams, your check-in process should be quick and easy. It typically takes less than 10 seconds, and the program with which you integrate updates an OKR's progress every hour. 

Consider the previous example. Your key result is to increase customer-facing knowledge base articles from 25 to 100 during the quarter. Your team actively tracks its article count using Azure DevOps, which you've linked directly to your Viva Goals key result. Therefore, you don't have to enter numbers manually to check in. Azure DevOps pulls data automatically hourly so that whenever you mark an article as published, Viva Goals will reflect that update. 

Additionally, with integrated check-ins, you can:

 - Select the **Sync** button to refresh metrics immediately, if you need more current data than the hourly update provides. An example of when you might require this is if you're about to present at a monthly OKR review meeting. 
 - Perform a check-in directly from a collaboration platform in which you're working, such as Teams or Slack, thereby seamlessly checking in while not disrupting your workflow.

#### Benefits of Viva Goals data integrations 

Viva Goals supports integration with industry-leading tools and platforms you use every day, which means your OKR implementation process is as simple, effective, and seamless as possible. Configuring integrations offers several advantages, including that: 

- Check-ins occur automatically, without disrupting your workflow and requiring you to stop what you're doing to manually check in.
- All data flows from a single source, which helps eliminate redundancy.
- There's support for many third-party integrations. For a comprehensive list of supported integrations, refer to [Viva Goals integrations overview](../../goals/integrations-overview.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Your administrator must set up integrations before you and other users can connect them to your OKRs. For more information, refer to [Viva Goals Integrations Administration Overview](../../goals/vg-integrations-administration-overview.md).
