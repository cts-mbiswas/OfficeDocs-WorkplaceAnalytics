# Make a good OKR great

When you're writing OKRs, always remember that progress is more important than perfection. It's important to get your OKRs written, even if you feel they're less than stellar. You might ask yourself, “How do I know if my OKRs are any good? How do I turn good OKRs into great OKRs?” Well, there are a few tips you can employ, including a mindset of continuous improvement that evolves by asking questions.

## Tip #1: Ask questions while writing your OKRs

Are you ready to draft your OKRs? As you do, it's important to ask:

- What's the most important area of business to focus on?  
- Why does that matter right now?  
- How should that be written into a statement to inspire the team?
- What metric indicates success?
- Is that metric currenty measured?
- What's the target and baseline?  

## Tip #2: Ask questions while reviewing your OKRs

You've got your OKRs written, and now you're reviewing them. As you do, it's important to ask:

- Do the OKRs stretch beyond “business as usual” goals and reach for ambitious outcomes?
- Are they too comprehensive? We recommend having between three and five desired key results per OKR.
- Can the team directly impact the results or must they rely on stakeholders? If the answer is the latter, ask yourself whether you can share the OKR. 
- Are the correct owners identified, meaning the ones who are accountable for driving progress?
- Is progress on each key result actually possible in the designated time period? 
- Who should review the OKRs to ensure they're clear, concise, and measurable from an *outsider* perspective?

## Tip #3: Ask questions as you enter your OKRs into Viva Goals

You've done the hard work. You've written, reviewed, and polished your OKRs. You're now ready to implement them by entering them into Viva Goals. As you do, it's important to ask:

- Are integrations configured to pull from a single source of truth, whenever possible? This helps enable faster and better decision making based on dynamic, real-time data and insights. 
- Do the goals align from top down, bottom up, and across teams to ensure everyone in the organization drives toward the same purpose?  
- Are the OKRs public so that all team members can review them? This creates accountability and helps determine potential surface dependencies and roadblocks.

## Tip #4: Ask whether your OKRs pass the *necessary and sufficient* test

You've implemented your OKRs. It's important to periodically review and (potentially) update your OKRs. As you do, it's vital to ask:

- Do the OKRs pass the *necessary and sufficient* test, meaning are all key results actually necessary to achieve the objective?
    - If yes, your key results are just what you need to meet your goals.
    - If no, remove them. They're not necessary.
- Will accomplishing key results be sufficient enough to achieve the objective?
    - If yes, your key results are sufficient to help you achieve your goals.
    - If no, modify them to align them more closely with your objective. 

## Examples of taking OKRs from good to great

The following sections provide examples of how you can push your OKRs into the realm of greatness.

### Example of an objective

Consider the following objective: "Make more money outside of the United States." If you're trying to craft an exceptional OKR, this objective isn't necessarily helpful. Most businesses must make money, so this objective is too broad and vague. Objectives should be actionable, aspirational, or meaningful, or preferably, all three. And they should follow the formula: 

 - <*A verb*> + <*what you're going to do*> + so that <*what*> + in order to <*what*>. 

Using that formula, take that broad objective and make it more targetted, such as "Expand into the Latin America market in order to increase product market share."

That objective is clear, meaningful, and it follows the formula. 

### Example of key results

Leveraging the clarified, targeted objective, you now can drill into the key results you hope to obtain from your Sales and Marketing departments, such as:

 - Increase new product sales from $100,000 to $1.5 million (Sales).
 - Increase social-media views from 5,000 to 15,000 (Marketing).
 - Increase qualified leads generated from a web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing). 

Strong key results, similar to objectives, should be focused, measurable, and generally follow the formula: 

 - <*A verb*> + <*what you're going to track*> + <*count*> + <*from x to y*>.  

When you consider the example and formula, you might realize that the stakeholder (the product team) isn't included. You could add a key result that centers around developing a Spanish-language version of your product. Now, your key results would be: 

 - Increase new product sales from $100,000 to $1.5 million (Sales).
 - Increase social-media views from 5,000 to 15,000 (Marketing).
 - Increase qualified leads generated from a web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing).
 - **Increase users of the Spanish language app from 0 to 10,000 (Product)**. 

### Questions to ask about the OKR example

As you ponder the examples, there are questions you should ask, including:

 - Are the four key results solid? The answer is yes, the example key results are actionable and clear.
 - Do the example OKRs pass the *necessary and sufficient* test? Well, actually, when you apply the *necessary and sufficient* test, you determine that the current key results are good but not great. You realize that increasing social-media views isn't necessary to meet your objectives and decide to remove it. Additionally, you need to increase users of the Spanish language app, so you decide to add more Spanish-speaking sales reps. Therefore, your new key results would be:
   
    - Increase new product sales from $100k to $ 1.5 m (Sales).
    - Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing).
    - Increase users of the Spanish language app from 0 to 10,000 (Product).
    - **Increase bilingual sales staff from two to five (People)**.

 - Are there initiatives that are required now that our key results are finalized?
     - Yes, you must create an initiative for the product team, since they haven't launched the Spanish language app yet. The initiative could be "**Launch a Spanish language version of our app for Android and iOS.**

> [!NOTE]
> The questions that we recommended you ask about the example OKRs are ones you can ask yourself as you develop your own OKRs.

## Summary

As the examples depicted, you can take a mediocre OKR with a vague objective and turn it into a great one that has an inspirational objective, measurable key results, and an action-focused initiative.
