## Alignment definition

The concept of alignment within Viva Goals refers to the process of linking Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) up, down, and across an organization.

Aligning your goals can help your organization:

- Use resources and time more efficiently
- Focus on and communicate top priorities
- Adapt to the digital needs of a hybrid or remote workforce
- Connect work groups that are siloed, disconnected, or doing redundant work

When OKRs are properly aligned, individuals can clearly see how the work they do as part of a team contributes to the overall purpose, and makes working with cross-functional teams and remote co-workers easier.

## Alignment framework: Top down and bottom up

Aligning goals using a combined top-down and bottom-up approach helps everyone in your organization work together.

### Top-down alignment

In a top-down approach, senior leaders start by defining a company’s overall mission, vision, and values. They then define goals based on the organization's purpose. Being clear helps inform the strategy and direction to take.

From there, senior leadership defines annual Objectives and Key Results, the most important 3-5 goals that the company wants to achieve in the coming year.

Guidance from top leaders is critical, as they set the direction for where the company is heading.

### Bottom-up alignment

Once senior leadership has defined top-level annual OKRs, it's time to take input from non-leadership members of your organization. Employees outside of management and leadership are vital to communicating the critical day-to-day key results that contribute to the overall goals of the company. Bottom-up alignment empowers teams to create their own OKRs in support of the top 3-5 goals on a company level. Bottom-up alignment allows teams to use their experience to determine the best way to drive impact for that time period.

### Visualizing OKR alignment

Once company-level OKRs are in place, teams (including Departments, Divisions, etc.) can align their Objectives up to the company level. Then, smaller sub-teams can align their Objectives to the Objectives of the parent team.

> [!NOTE]
> These child Objectives are not identical to the ones above it, but in support of them.

Consider the following example:

One of the main Objectives at the company level is to create and engaged and diverse workforce. The objective might be:

- **Objective**: Create an inclusive and engaging company culture.

Appropriately, the metrics for success at the company level might focus on the team thriving, and being more diverse:

- **Key Result 1:** Improve our Thrive score by 20%.
- **Key Result 2:** Improve our diversity and inclusion percentage point for leadership by 4.

When this HR team meets to set their OKRs, they can see that one of the critical goals for senior leadership is to improve company culture.

In this case, this HR team is in the best position to know how to accomplish this mission since they are the experts on talent acquisition and retention for their company. Therefore, this HR team can set their own objectives for this mission using bottom-up knowledge.

The Objectives they might set are:

- **Objective 1:** Increase pathways to leadership for underrepresented communities.
- **Objective 2:** Adjust compensation packages to reflect market rates.

This example shows senior leaders creating a top-down mission, and a team using their specialized knowledge to create bottom-up OKRs in service of the larger goal.
