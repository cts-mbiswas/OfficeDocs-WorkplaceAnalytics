# Viva Goals retirement

## Viva Goals to be retired on December 31, 2025

Viva Goals will be retired on December 31, 2025. Microsoft will continue to maintain Viva Goals’ availability, accessibility, and security through retirement. However, as of December 5, 2024, Microsoft will no longer invest in new feature development.

While Viva Goals is being retired, Microsoft remains fully committed to the Viva suite, continuing to innovate and deliver tools to help our customers drive meaningful business impact.

## How will this affect you?

We know changes like this can affect your workflows, and we’re here to make this as smooth as possible. Here’s what to expect:

- **Continued access:** Viva Goals will continue to be available to our existing customers until December 31, 2025, to provide you with an opportunity to plan for its end-of-life transition to other OKR solutions if desired. We will continue to maintain Viva Goals' availability, accessibility, and security of the product, and provide product support until its retirement.

- **No new functionality** Viva Goals will no longer add any new features or functionality to the product. All current design change requests (DCRs) will be closed and no new DCRs will be accepted.

- **Data migration options:** Viva Goals offers data export features via [API](/graph/api/goals-post-exportjobs?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http), [Excel](/viva/goals/explorer#save-and-export), and [PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/engage-with-viva-goals-365500a4-0599-41cd-bc86-09bef4206284), allowing users to move their data to a solution of their choice. we recommend that users export their data before December 31, 2025.
