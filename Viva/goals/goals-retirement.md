# Viva Goals retirement

## Viva Goals to be retired on December 31, 2025

Viva Goals will be retired on December 31, 2025. As of December 5, 2024, Microsoft will no longer invest in new feature development for Viva Goals.

Microsoft remains fully committed to the Viva suite as a whole, and will continue to innovate and deliver tools to help our customers succeed.

## How will the deprecation affect your organization?

Here's what to expect. You can refer to this article and to the [FAQ](goals-retirement-faq.md) to understand how to minimize disruption to your workflows and transition as smoothly as possible.

- **Continued Access:** Viva Goals will continue to be available to our existing customers until December 31, 2025, to ensure time for a planned transition to other OKR solutions. Until the retirement date, Microsoft will continue to provide support through security patches and critical bug fixes.

- **Data Migration Options:** You can export data from Viva Goals through [API](/graph/api/goals-post-exportjobs?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http), [Excel](/viva/goals/explorer#save-and-export), and [PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/engage-with-viva-goals-365500a4-0599-41cd-bc86-09bef4206284). By using this export capability, your organization can move data to a solution of your choice. We recommend that users export their data before December 31, 2025.
