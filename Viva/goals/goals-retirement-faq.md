# Viva Goals retirement FAQ

## Why is Viva Goals being deprecated?

Two years ago, we launched Viva Goals with a mission of empowering every team and organization to achieve more through focused goal management using the OKR methodology. However, overall adoption and usage of Viva Goals are low. To better focus on solutions with stronger adoption and market fit, Microsoft has made the decision to retire Viva Goals on December 31, 2025, and discontinue any further development of the product.

## What does this mean for the rest of the Viva suite?

Microsoft remains committed to Viva and will continue to invest and prioritize development across other Viva suite areas. We're increasing investment in areas related to change management and user enablement for Copilot and the AI transformation. Most recently at Ignite 2024, we unveiled exciting new capabilities in Microsoft Viva.

## How long will users have access to Viva Goals?

Users will have access to Viva Goals and their data until December 31, 2025, or until their licenses expire, whichever comes first. After this date, Viva Goals will no longer be accessible.

## How can I export my data from Viva Goals?

You can export your data through [API](/graph/api/goals-post-exportjobs?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http), [Excel](/viva/goals/explorer#save-and-export), and [PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/engage-with-viva-goals-365500a4-0599-41cd-bc86-09bef4206284). It's recommended to export your data before December 31, 2025, to ensure that you have time to move your data to a solution of your choice.

## How will deprecation affect integrations with other tools?

Integrations between Viva Goals and other tools, such as Teams or Azure DevOps, will remain functional until December 31, 2025. After that, these integrations will cease to operate. It's recommended to identify alternative workflows and adjust your integration strategies accordingly.

## Will there be continued support for Viva Goals up to the deprecation date?

Yes. Microsoft will provide support for Viva Goals until December 31, 2025. This support includes maintenance, troubleshooting, and user assistance to ensure a smooth transition period for all users.

## Will I be able to request an extension beyond the retirement date?

No. The Viva Goals product will be shut down on December 31, 2025. It is not possible to extend usage past this date. If your subscription extends beyond the productâ€™s retirement date, contact your Microsoft representative for assistance.
