# Viva Goals retirement FAQ

## Why is Viva Goals being deprecated?

Two years ago, we launched Viva Goals with a mission of empowering every team and organization to achieve more through focused goal management using the OKR methodology. While some customers have valued its functionality, overall adoption and usage of Viva Goals have remained low. Since launch, we have not seen substantive adoption and usage and have decided to deprecate the product over the next 13 months with retirement of Viva Goals on **December 31, 2025**.

## What does this mean for the rest of the Viva suite?

We remain committed to Viva and will continue to invest and prioritize development across other Viva suite areas. With more than 66 million active users, we see strong adoption and have increased investment in areas related to change management and user enablement of Copilot and the AI transformation. Most recently at Ignite 2024, we unveiled exciting new capabilities in Microsoft Viva.

## Will Viva Goals be replaced with another solution?

Microsoft won't be replacing Viva Goals or integrating its functionality into other products. Existing customers will have until December 31, 2025, or until their licenses expire, to transition to an alternative solution. We're actively exploring third-party solutions and partnerships to facilitate a smoother transition and will update these FAQs as new information becomes available.

## How long will users have access to Viva Goals?

Users will have access to Viva Goals and their data until December 31, 2025, or until their licenses expire, whichever comes first. After this date, Viva Goals will no longer be accessible.

## How can I export my data from Viva Goals?

Viva Goals offers data export features via [API](/graph/api/goals-post-exportjobs?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http), [Excel](/viva/goals/explorer#save-and-export), and [PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/engage-with-viva-goals-365500a4-0599-41cd-bc86-09bef4206284), allowing users to move their data to a solution of their choice. We recommend that users export their data before December 31, 2025.

## How will deprecation affect integrations with other tools?

Integrations between Viva Goals and other tools (for example, Teams, Azure DevOps) will remain functional until December 31, 2025. After that, these integrations will cease to operate.

## Will there be continued support for Viva Goals up to the deprecation date?

Yes, Microsoft will continue to maintain Viva Goals’ availability, accessibility, and security and provide product support until December 31, 2025. This support includes maintenance, troubleshooting, and user assistance to ensure a smooth transition period for all customers.

## Will I be able to request an extension beyond the retirement date?

No. The Viva Goals product will be shut down entirely on December 31, 2025, and we won't be able to extend usage past this date. If your subscription extends beyond the product’s retirement date, contact your Microsoft representative for assistance.

## Can I renew my licenses until the retirement date?

Reach out to your Microsoft representative or submit a support case in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center for assistance.
