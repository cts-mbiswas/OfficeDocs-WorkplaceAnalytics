# View and customize your general settings

There are a few **General settings** you can configure to customize your Viva Insights experience.

You can access them in the [advanced insights app](https://analysis.insights.cloud.microsoft/). On the left, under **Settings**, select **General**.  

## Analyst notification emails 

*Applies to: Insights Analyst*

As a Viva Insights analyst, you’ll receive a query notification email that provides the status of your recent queries, for both successful and failed queries. You can also download the query results .csv output file or view the Power BI template from the email.

You’ll receive only one notification email per day, encompassing both recurring and non-recurring queries. If you’ve completed multiple queries in a single day, you’ll receive the email only for the first completed query. Results for other queries are still accessible from the **Query results** page in the analyst workbench. 

The analyst query notification email is on by default. To unsubscribe:

1. Sign in to the Viva Insights portal with your Insights Analyst credentials. 

2. On the left, select **Settings**, then select **Analyst notification email**. 

3. Clear the setting **Receive Analyst notification email**. 

4. Select **Save**. You can also access these preferences by selecting **Unsubscribe** at the bottom of the email.
