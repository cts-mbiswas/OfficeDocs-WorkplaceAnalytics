# Manage academies in Viva Learning

Use Viva Learning academy to curate pages for selected learners to develop business-critical capabilities through a facilitated learning experience. 

The academy goes beyond technical and functional skills and focuses on the business capabilities a company needs to thrive. You can curate an academy by using a group of learning paths focused on specific learning objectives. 

Academies are set up and managed on the admin tab in Viva Learning under **Manage Academies**. 

Creating and editing academies involves managing featured sets and learning paths.
