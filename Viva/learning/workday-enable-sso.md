# Enable SSO on Workday


Viva Learning and Workday integration allows seamless authentication (SSO). On Teams Desktop and Web, users can directly consume a course on Workday portal without the need to sign in via Workday credentials. On Teams mobile, user need to enter the credentials for first time. 

Refer to the [SSO integration between Workday and Viva Learning](/entra/identity/saas-apps/workday-tutorial).
