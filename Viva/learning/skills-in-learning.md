# Skills-based learning in Viva Learning

Use skills-based learning experiences to improve personalization for learners and allow admins to automatically enrich their content metadata.
The following skills-based scenarios are enabled in **private preview** for Viva Learning:

**Learners**

- Personalized skill suggestions based on the learner's activities in Microsoft 365 and their role.
- If selected by learners, these skill suggestions provide focused courses. 
- Improved learning content suggestions and search relevance with enriched content metadata through autogenerated tags.

**Admins**

- Skills included in the organization's skills library are incorporated into Viva Learning once the library is published to Viva Learning.
- Admins can export content metadata to review the autogenerated tags for content catalog and use them for content recommendations and search relevance. 
- Admins can view the autogenerated tag for each content through the **Edit** button on content details page. They can review the autogenerated tags and also disable the autogenerated tags for specific content from being used for content recommendations and search relevance.

## Considerations 

> [!NOTE]
> - Skills-based experiences in Viva Learning aren't supported on mobile for preview. 
> - Skills preview is only supported in the English-US language.

Set the **Default Language** for Viva Learning to English-US (en-US) by going to the Viva Learning **Admin** tab and then selecting **Language preferences**.

- When Skills is enabled in Viva Learning, any interests that users previously selected in Viva Learning not in en-US are deleted. Users lose all associated personalized experiences in Viva Learning. This applies to **both** users who are part of the preview and those who aren't part of the preview.  

- If en_US interests aren't included as skills, then en_US interests selections are also lost.
To ensure users interests selection and associated personalized experience for en_US interests selection aren't lost, existing en_US interests need to be included as **skills**. Follow these steps to [retain your current en-US interests as skills](#retain-your-current-interests-as-skills).


- Any tags manually added to the content prior to the current preview not in en-US are lost. Follow these steps to [retain your current en-US interests as skills](#retain-your-current-interests-as-skills).

- Admins should only select **Allow Skills in Viva Learning** if they're ready to delete existing interest-related content and data in line with the above information. 


#### Retain your current interests as skills

To ensure any existing interests in en-US are included as skills when your organization turns on skills in Viva Learning: 

> [!NOTE] 
> Skills that are not en_US are lost.

- Export your organization's current interests in Viva Learning by going to the Viva Learning **Admin** tab > Manage interests > Export. Download the file when the export is processed. 

- Go to **Manage skills library** in the Microsoft 365 admin center and follow these steps to import your organization's existing interests as custom skills. Once the import is complete, you need to allow skills in Viva Learning.

  > [!NOTE]
  > During the data migration, ensure that the external code of interests in Viva Learning is the same for the skills during the custom skills import.

## Skills in Viva Learning

These "manage skills" scenarios are available in preview:

1. When you allow skills to be available in Viva Learning from the skills setup and management experience (Microsoft 365 admin center), the existing **Import** and **Export** buttons are hidden in the Manage Skills view. Learning starts importing skills from your organization's skills library in the Microsoft 365 admin center to power the app's skills experiences. 

2. Admins can view any skills and skills description with supported languages that are available in their skills library from the skills library from the **Admin** tab in Learning.

3. Admins go to their organization's skills library directly from learning to update and manage the library and settings.

- Learners can browse all the skills available in their organization alphabetically and can search for specific skills.

- Once learners find a subject theyâ€™d like to upskill or reskill in, they can select that skill to receive personalized course content. They can also remove or deselect current skills to stop receiving content on the subject. 

- Search results can be filtered based on the skills.

- Skills in Viva Learning are displayed in the language that organizations set for their users in the Teams app or at the tenant level. 

## Using autogenerated skills tags 

Any tags that were manually added to content prior to the current preview will be lost if they aren't in en-US. Follow these steps to [retain your current en-US interests as skills.](#retain-your-current-interests-as-skills)

Both auto and manual content tagging are supported only for English language in the current preview. 

The following content tagging scenarios enabled for admins in the preview:

- Admins can export content metadata to review the autogenerated tags for the content catalog. After review, admins can also provide consent to use autogenerated tags for improved search relevance and content recommendations. 

  ![Screenshot of the manage content metadata tab with the option to bulk export and consent to autogenerated skill tags.](../media/learning/skills-bulk-import.png)

- Admins can view the autogenerated tag for each content using the **Edit** button on the Content details page to either review autogenerated tags or disable ones that aren't relevant.

  ![Screenshot of the edit skill tags popup with the option to enable or disable autogenerated skill tags](../media/learning/skills-autogenerated-tags.png)

Learners can view enhanced content recommendations and enhanced search relevance through autogenerated tags. 

> [!NOTE]
> Auto-generated tags for new content ingested into Viva Learning are periodically added. Auto-generated tags for the entire catalog aren't refreshed periodically.
