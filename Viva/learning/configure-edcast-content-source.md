# Configure EdCast as a content source for Microsoft Viva Learning

This article shows you how to configure EdCast as a third-party learning content source in Viva Learning. You need a Microsoft Viva Suite or Viva Learning license to add EdCast as a content source for your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Content accessible through Viva Learning is subject to terms other than the Microsoft Product Terms. EdCast content and any associated services are subject to EdCast's privacy and service terms.

## Configure in your EdCast portal

> [!NOTE]
> Your organization must have an active subscription to EdCast as well as a premium license for Microsoft Viva Learning.

You need Your EdCast API key, Secret, Client Host URL, and User Email for Viva Learning to surface content from your EdCast instance.

1. Your organization's EdCast administrator can obtain your EdCast API key and Secret by reaching out to your dedicated EdCast Customer Success Manager.

2. Your Client host URL is the same as your EdCast instance URL. It should look like "[subdomain].edcast.com".

## Configure in your Microsoft 365 admin center

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to have admin permissions in Microsoft 365 to complete these steps.

1. Sign in to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Navigate to **Settings**, then **Org settings**. Select Viva Learning, and enable EdCast in the panel.
3. Fill in the configuration details that you got from your EdCast Customer Success Manager.
4. Select **Save** to activate EdCast content in Viva Learning. It can take up to 24 hours for the content to display in the Viva Learning app.
