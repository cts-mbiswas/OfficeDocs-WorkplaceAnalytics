# Microsoft Learn

[Microsoft Learn](/teamblog/introducing-ms-learn) content is available for all users of Viva Learning. This is enabled by default and can be managed in the **Manage Providers** section of Viva [Learning Admin tab](https://learning.cloud.microsoft/admin).

## Features

All Microsoft Learn content have Single-Sign On (SSO) enabled for all Viva Learning users by default. Now, users are automatically signed in to their Learn profile and can continue their learning from their last visited page of content.

If users have more than one account logged in or no existing account, the Learn website prompts the user to choose or create their profile. Admins can't switch off Microsoft Learn SSO.

## Update Cycle 

Microsoft Learn content gets updated daily. It may take 1-2 days for updates to reflect in Viva Learning App.
