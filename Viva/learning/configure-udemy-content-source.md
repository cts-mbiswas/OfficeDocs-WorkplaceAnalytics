# Configure Udemy as a content source for Microsoft Viva Learning

This article shows you how to configure Udemy as a third-party learning content source for Microsoft Viva Learning. You need a Microsoft Viva Suite or Viva Learning license to add Udemy as a content source for your organization.

>[!NOTE]
>Content accessible through Viva Learning is subject to terms other than the Microsoft Product Terms. Udemy content and any associated services are subject to Udemy's privacy and service terms.

## Configure in your Udemy portal

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need to have admin permissions in Udemy to complete these steps.

Follow these steps to enable the APIs in your Udemy Business environment and generate client credentials for your LMS/LXP application to access them.

Submit a support ticket to [Udemy Business Support](https://business-support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?type=user) to request the Course Collection Sync API  enablement for {organization}.udemy.com. Replace {organization} with your own Udemy subdomain. 

1. Navigate to **Manage**, then **Settings**, then **API**. Check the status of your APIs. If they're disabled, you can contact support for enablement or follow the following steps to enable them yourself.

3. In the following screen, type in the name of your custom LMS/LXP or third-party application. Then, turn on or off the auto enrollment option and select **Save**. The auto enrollment option allows users that launch a course through their LMS/LXP to automatically be enrolled in Udemy.

5. To access the API endpoints, you need to have your ACCOUNT_ID and endpoint URL. You can access this information and also try out the APIs by navigating to **Manage**, then **Settings**, then **API**. Once you enable the APIs, you should see the status of the APIs as "Enabled." Select the API documentation link.
