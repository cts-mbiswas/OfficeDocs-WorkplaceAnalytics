# Create RaaS reports for catalog, user, assignment, and completion data

This article consists of steps required for enabling catalog, user, assignment, and completion data sync in Workday and Viva Learning integration. 
Admins are required to create a custom RaaS report on the Workday portal. Once you have created integration system user of Workday portal and have provided all security access, follow these steps to create the required RaaS reports.  


> [!NOTE]
> All RaaS reports (catalog, user data, LRS) should be created from same user account or a single user should be given report ownership at Workday portal. This username should be inserted under Reporting URL attribute in Viva Learning Manage Provider. Review this example: `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/microsoft_dpt6/username/Viva_Learning_Catalog_Report.`

> [!NOTE]
> Admins need to create a custom report manually. This is a one time process. We are only supporting the report structure mentioned in this support article, any other changes in reports are not recommended.

1. Ensure that the **Workday to AAD user sync** is in place for your tenant.  
2. Enable inbound user provisioning with Workday to ensure that all users in Workday are synced to Azure Active Directory (AAD).
3. If you're already a Microsoft 365 customer, Workday to AAD user sync should be in place for your tenant. 

Check with your organization admins for details around same. Otherwise, you can refer to the steps mentioned here to enable the provisioning. [Tutorial: Configure Workday for automatic user provisioning with on-premises Active Directory](/entra/identity/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verify that XML alias for the report field names, filter names, and prompt names match precisely with the support documentation after creating the report. 

## Create RaaS report on the Workday portal for catalog sync

    2. Add following values in the new prompts and select “OK”.

       - For Starting Prompt, add value StartDate in fields Label for Prompt and Label for Prompt XML Alias
       - For Ending Prompt, add value EndDate in fields Label for Prompt and Label for Prompt XML Alias

1. Go to **Advanced.** Uncheck the field **Optimized for Performance**. 

1. Save the field. Select **OK**.

1. Share the report with Integrated System User (ISU) and respective security group, which you created while enabling content sync. Go to the **Share** section in the report, select “Share with specific authorized groups and users” and add group name and user name in Authorized Groups and Authorized users field. 

1. Within the next 24 hours, the LRS sync calls the report API and accordingly reflects the data in Viva Learning. This depends on whether the admin has enabled LRS on Admin portal. Refer to this document for configuration steps on the Admin portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Lessons aren't supported in self-enrollment completion status.

> [!NOTE]
> If the tenant refreshes, the report owner can automatically change to the system owner. This change in owner status also changes the API url for Viva Learning. For the connection to work, you can either reconfigure the Workday connector or transfer the report to the original owner.
