# Microsoft Viva Glint Patient Safety Survey - methodology

The methodology used to develop the Microsoft Viva Glint Patient Safety Survey followed these steps:

- **Exploratory interviews** with external patient safety experts and practitioners
- A thorough **literature review on the culture of patient safety which included over 90 articles and 15-20 patient safety culture survey instruments**. All Leapfrog-approved instruments are included
- **Development of a 295-item taxonomy with 48 different patient safety domains**.
- **The list was culled down to 80 items and 18 domains for scientific testing**. Items were evaluated for clarity and simplicity. Items assessing the same or similar constructs were removed.
- Viva Glint researchers **developed several theoretical models** of patient safety culture for scientific testing based on their findings.
- **A random sample of over 1,300 full-time healthcare professionals in the U.S., consistent with Leapfrogâ€™s guidance, received the items**. AHRQ items and actual patient safety outcomes. Leapfrog grade, HCAHPS patient satisfaction data, Hospital-acquired infections, and Post-surgical infections were included in the item set for validation purposes.
- **Statistical testing and additional feedback provided validity and reliability information to choose the best performing items for the final instrument**. Tests and processes included:
  - Factor analysis (single factor, EFA, CFA)
  - Reliability analysis (alpha)
  - Alpha-if-item-Deleted
  - Correlations
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis
  - Standard deviation
  - Correlations to established or validated culture of patient safety items (i.e., AHRQ)
  - Correlation to overall Culture of Patient Safety outcome - a two-item outcome measure was developed after careful testing. The extent to which other items correlated to this outcome was a factor in selecting the item.
  - Inter-item correlations
  - Correlations to publicly reported external patient safety outcome measures like HCAHPS, Leapfrog grades, and Infections
  - Relative weights analysis
  - Proportion of variance explained in the facet
  - Survey review by our expert team
  - Final review by five external patient safety experts

**After thorough testing, single-marker items were chosen for various safety topics** such as *Just culture*, *Psychological safety*, *Communication*, *Teamwork*, *Across-department communication*, and *Leadership commitment to safety*. 

**Top performing items were identified and additional testing was done on the final 16 items**. 

**A 62-page technical report was assembled and sent to Leapfrogâ€™s expert panel for validation.**

> [!NOTE]
> Viva Glint received Leapfrog approval in June of 2020.
