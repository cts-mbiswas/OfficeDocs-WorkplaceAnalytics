# Propel action-taking through conversations with Microsoft Viva Glint

The likelihood of employee feedback 
fueling organizational success hinges on the 
actions taken based on that feedback. Many 
companies build excitement and energy 
around taking the survey: “We want to hear 
from you!” and “Thank you for the feedback!”.

somewhere between “Here’s what we’re going 
to do about your feedback!” and what actually 
gets done to address issues and make positive 
incremental changes
