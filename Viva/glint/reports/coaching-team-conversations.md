# Set up Viva Glint Team Conversations Presentation Kit for managers

The last survey setup page in Program Summary is the Coaching page. Managers who have Team Conversations enabled benefit from this extra guidance when admins make it available for them.

**Customize the Team Conversations Presentation Kit to help your managers have successful conversations around survey results.**

- Team Conversations must be enabled in Program Setup.
- If your program is in an approved state, disable the program. Toggle to **NO** so editing can occur. Select **Save changes**.
- The Presentation Kit must be set up before survey results are released.
- Managers configure the *Pick a Focus Area* and *Choose Action Items* sections with their team. They are unable to make any other changes to the presentation.

## Presentation Kit section setup

This information applies to each section:
- The Section Name for each page - used for navigation and can be customized
- Customize content by selecting **Edit** to reveal the slider panel - use the default text content provided or customize
- **Preview** - at any time
- **Save Changes** - after editing each section
- **Each translation added autosaves after another language is selected** - multiple language selections autosave.  

### Title

Add your spin to the first slide to welcome the team.

- **Section Name** - Customize or use the default
- **Conversation Title** - Fill in the macro fields to personalize the slide title

### Introduction

Personalize headings and body content for three conversation points. You must include at least three conversation points. Use the **+ button** to add macro fields if desired.

### Reflection Point

The Presentation Kit makes two Reflection Point pages available for managers. The first is for the team to consider *before* reviewing their results; the second is for *after* viewing results. Both pages can be turned on or off.

- **Show Reflection** - Switch the button to **ON** or **OFF** to include or exclude the slide

### How We're Doing

- Relative Strengths slide
- Relative Opportunities slide
- Multiple Choice Questions slide - The preview shows all multiple-choice questions, but the actual manager presentation only shows the questions from the applicable cycle.
