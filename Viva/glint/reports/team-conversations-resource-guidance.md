# Add resource guidance for managers using Team Conversations

From the **Coaching** tab, in the bottom section - **Team Conversations Resource Guidance** - enable or disable guidance by switching to **On** or **Off**. Enabling guidance allows you to select a resource from the dropdown menu. Guidance is specific to the process of conversations. Guidance doesn't correlate with the Focus Area a team is working on. There are many resources to choose from!
