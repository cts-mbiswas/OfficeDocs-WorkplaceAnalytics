## Access with a Microsoft Entra ID user account

Your Entra or other IT admins choose [authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods) for Glint and other resources. For example: username and password + multifactor authentication with an app like Microsoft Authenticator. Select a link based on the region that your organization's Glint tenant sits in and follow prompts to log in.

- EU - [http://app.eu1.glint.cloud.microsoft](http://app.eu1.glint.cloud.microsoft)

## Session timeout

After 20 minutes of inactivity, you're prompted with an initial **"Are you still here?"** message. A Glint session ends after another 10 minutes of inactivity.

## Connection issue

If you see a message indicating that a connection canâ€™t be made to the Glint service, there's likely an issue with matching your information between the Glint application and Microsoft Entra ID. Contact your Glint or Entra admin to confirm that your data matches between systems.
