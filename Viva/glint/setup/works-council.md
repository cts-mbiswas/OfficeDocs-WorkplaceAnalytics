When it comes to partnering with your Works Council, advanced preparation is key. 

|Tip #|Tip|Description|
|:---:|----|------|

|4| **Treat your Works Council as another stakeholder in the process.** |Works Council is interested in employees’ opinions, should be receptive to the concept of employee engagement surveys, and ensure they're well executed.|
|5|**Find out what approvals are needed, by when, and by whom.** | Sometimes there are limited windows for approval from your Works Council. Know how to navigate the necessary approval.|
