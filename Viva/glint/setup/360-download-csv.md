# 360 Feedback program CSV Subject, Feedback Provider, and Coach CSV reports

For any 360 cycle in draft or scheduled status, admins can download a CSV file by selecting the **Import Subjects** button and then the **Download CSV** link.

Download a CSV file to:
- Perform a bulk upload or download of Subjects
- Receive a time-based release of your 360 report
- Perform a bulk extension of the 360 end date for Subjects

Open your CSV download in a new tab. These columns generate:

|Column|Column header|
|------|---------|
|A|Sujbect Employee ID|
|B|Subject Email Address|
|C|Subject First Name (optional)|
|D|Subject Last Name (optional)|
|E|Coach Employee ID|
|F|Coach Email Address|
|G|Coach First Name (optional)|
|H|Coach Last Name (optional)|
|I|Remove Action|
|J|Glint Error Message - Leave Blank

## Use the Remove Action column

There are three ways to use the **Remove Action** column:

- Leave the cell blank to bulk upload a Subject or a Subject/Coach pair for a cycle
- Insert **SUBJECT** into a cell to remove the Subject from that cycle
- Insert **COACH** to keep the subject but remove the subject's coach from that cycle
