# Viva Glint Always-On Feedback surveys

Always-On Feedback surveys provide insight on any topic, at any time, from any group of people in your organization. Always-On Feedback helps leaders make timely decisions about how best to invest in their people and programs. Different than scheduled surveys, Always-On surveys are ready to provide insights in real time.

An Always-On surveys should be:
- communicated to your people to explain why it is different than a scheduled survey, why the information is being collected, and what you intend to learn from and do with the data.
- quick and easy to complete. Keep surveys under five minutes; they should take no longer than three minutes to complete.

Always-On surveys provide specific information about a topic, whether it be programmatic, problem-specific, or strategy-driven. The platform delivers results like averages and comparisons to relevant benchmarks, complex pattern recognition, and business outcome linkage. Unstructured data like comments and suggestions are summarized, and the themes are reported by Viva Glint’s Narrative Intelligence engine.

**Consider these use cases:**

- Track engagement confidence levels before and after a major event.
- Get suggestions for improving policies and procedures.
- Ask people during a tough time, “What can leaders do to support you right now?” 
- Are recent expats feeling supported in their new countries, especially given recent updates to the expat program?
- How confident are employees in our new product strategy?
- What are the most outstanding actions people have seen their colleagues do this month to help improve our company?

## Take action

The actions depend on the type of Always-On survey. The link between employee input to visible actions shows that your company appreciates and uses feedback. Similar to broader, scheduled surveys, it’s recommended to choose one or two action areas which will have the largest area of impact. This sets up the team for success.
