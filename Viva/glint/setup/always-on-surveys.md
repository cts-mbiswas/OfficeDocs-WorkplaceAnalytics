# Viva Glint Always-On Feedback surveys

Always-On Feedback surveys provide insight on any topic, at any time, from any group of people in your organization. Always-On Feedback helps leaders make timely decisions about how best to invest in their people and programs. Different than scheduled surveys, Always-On surveys are ready to provide insights in real time.

An Always-On surveys should be:
- communicated to your people to explain why it is different than a scheduled survey, why the information is being collected, and what you intend to learn from and do with the data.
- quick and easy to complete. Keep surveys under five minutes; they should take no longer than three minutes to complete.

Always-On surveys provide specific information about a topic, whether it be programmatic, problem-specific, or strategy-driven. The platform delivers results like averages and comparisons to relevant benchmarks, complex pattern recognition, and business outcome linkage. Unstructured data like comments and suggestions are summarized, and the themes are reported by Viva Glint’s Narrative Intelligence engine.

**Consider these use cases:**

- Track engagement confidence levels before and after a major event.
- Get suggestions for improving policies and procedures.
- Ask people during a tough time, “What can leaders do to support you right now?” 
- Are recent expats feeling supported in their new countries, especially given recent updates to the expat program?
- How confident are employees in our new product strategy?
- What are the most outstanding actions people have seen their colleagues do this month to help improve our company?

## Drive a succcessful program

Consider these aspects:

### Response Rate

You can send Always-On pulses to all your employees or a subset of employees. Participation is based on a few key aspects: the timeliness of the feedback being gathered, accessibility to the survey, reminders to provide input, and visible actions taken as a result of past feedback. 

#### Response rate calculation

Always-On surveys are open-ended and aren't calculated in the same manner as other Viva Glint survey types. Response rate percentage for Always-On surveys are calculated as follows:  
> Number of participants who submitted the survey divided by the total number of participants who started the survey. This includes respondants who may have submitted the survey more than once, which is permitted.

### Communication strategy

Always-On surveys should pair with the timing of an event, initiative, or situation. Manage your communication strategy to answer why the feedback is requested, what the input support, how the feedback will be used, and when employees can expect to hear back about the results. 

Send reminders in case the initial communication is missed.

### Insight to Actions

Consider the specific topic of your survey and focus of the question/item set. Look at what percent of the population responded and the breakdown of those responses to ensure there wasn't bias towards a certain segment of employees, a certain set of experiences, or a certain set of perspectives. If you've fumbled here, consider relaunching the survey to increase diverse feedback or host in-person meetings to gather more representative information. Now review the results to identify hot spots and bright spots, while using comment data to deepen your understanding of the feedback. Identify actions to take and create a strategy to move forward.

### Communication Loop

The entire communication loop from launch to survey close to the sharing of insights and actions supports the quantity and quality of employee feedback in the short and long-term. It provides visibility into how employee input positively impacts the organization. Communicate the results of the survey with the populations it impacts and keep them updated on the progress. Consider setting up discussion groups and follow-up meetings to further share and dive into the data.

## Take action

Team action depends on the type of Always-On survey. The link between employee input to visible actions shows that your company appreciates and uses feedback. Similar to broader, scheduled surveys, it’s recommended to choose only one or two action areas. This sets up the team for success.
