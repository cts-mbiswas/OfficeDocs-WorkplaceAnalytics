# Viva Glint Always-On Feedback surveys

Always-On Feedback surveys provide insight on any topic, at any time, from any group of people in your organization. Always-On feedback helps leaders make timely decisions about how best to invest in their people and programs. Different than scheduled surveys, Always-On surveys are ready to provide insights in real time.

Always-On surveys should be:
- communicated to your people to explain why it is different than a scheduled survey, why the information is being collected, and what you intend to learn from and do with the data.
- quick and easy to complete. Keep surveys under five minutes; they should take no longer than three minutes to complete.

Always-On surveys provide specific information about a topic, whether it be programmatic, problem-specific, or strategy-driven. The platform delivers descriptive results like averages and comparisons to relevant benchmarks, to complex “needle-in-a-haystack” pattern recognition and business outcome linkage. Unstructured data like comments and suggestions are summarized, and the themes are reported in real time by Viva Glint’s Narrative Intelligence engine.

**Consider these use cases:**

Track engagement confidence levels before and after a major event. Get suggestions for improving policies and procedures. Ask people during a tough time, “What can leaders do to support you right now?” Let people know how valuable their insight is to improving the company.
