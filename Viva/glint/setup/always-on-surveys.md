# Viva Glint Always-On Feedback surveys

Always-On Feedback surveys provide insight on any topic, at any time, from any group of people in your organization. Always-On Feedback helps leaders make timely decisions about how best to invest in their people and programs. Different than scheduled surveys, Always-On surveys are ready to provide insights in real time.

An Always-On surveys should be:
- communicated to your people to explain why it is different than a scheduled survey, why the information is being collected, and what you intend to learn from and do with the data.
- quick and easy to complete. Keep surveys under five minutes; they should take no longer than three minutes to complete.

Always-On surveys provide specific information about a topic, whether it be programmatic, problem-specific, or strategy-driven. The platform delivers results like averages and comparisons to relevant benchmarks, complex pattern recognition, and business outcome linkage. Unstructured data like comments and suggestions are summarized, and the themes are reported by Viva Glint’s Narrative Intelligence engine.

**Consider these use cases:**

- Track engagement confidence levels before and after a major event.
- Get suggestions for improving policies and procedures.
- Ask people during a tough time, “What can leaders do to support you right now?” 
- Are recent expats feeling supported in their new countries, especially given recent updates to the expat program?
- How confident are employees in our new product strategy?
- What are the most outstanding actions people have seen their colleagues do this month to help improve our company?

## Drive a succcessful program

Consider these aspects:

### Response Rate

You can send Always-On pulses to all your employees or a subset of employees. Participation is based on a few key aspects: the timeliness of the feedback being gathered, accessibility to the survey, reminders to provide input, and visible actions taken as a result of past feedback. 

### Always-On Feedback program calculation

Always-On surveys are open-ended and aren't calculated in the same manner as other Viva Glint survey types. Response rate percentage for Always-On surveys are calculated as follows:  
> Number of participants who submitted the survey divided by the total number of participants who started the survey. This includes respondants who may have submitted the survey more than once, which is permitted.

### Launch & Reminders

Pairing the launch of your Alway-On pulse with the timing of an event, initiative, situation, or problem creates the link between “what’s happening at the organization?” and “why my feedback is important given the situation?”. When launching the pulse, incorporate into your communication strategy: why the feedback is being requested, what the input is going to help or support, how the feedback will be used, and when employees can expect to hear back about the results of the pulse. For example, if you’re collecting information from your managers about the effectiveness of your monthly leadership training sessions, time the pulse to be taken the day after the session ends and communicate the value of their feedback to shape future training. Further, sending reminders out to employees to participate is important too, in case they missed the initial communication.

### Insight to Actions

The feedback supports your ability to take action. That’s why it’s important to consider the topic of your pulse and focus of the question set. Look at what percent of the population responded and the breakdown of those responses to ensure that the inputs aren’t biased towards a certain segment of employees, and thus a certain set of experiences or perspectives. If that’s the case, consider re-launching the pulse to increase the diversity feedback or hosting in-person meetings to gather more representative information. Then review the results to identify hot spots and bright spots, while using comment data to deepen your understanding of the feedback. Identify actions that can be taken and create a strategy to move forward.
Communication Loop
The entire communication loop from pulse launch to pulse close to the sharing of insights and actions supports the quantity and quality of employee feedback in the short- and long-term. Further, it provides visibility into how employee input positively impacts the organization. Communicate the results of the pulse with the populations that it impacts and keep them updated on the progress as necessary. Depending on what the Always-On pulse was meant to measure, consider setting up discussion groups and follow-up meetings to further share and dive into the data.

## Take action

The actions depend on the type of Always-On survey. The link between employee input to visible actions shows that your company appreciates and uses feedback. Similar to broader, scheduled surveys, it’s recommended to choose one or two action areas which will have the largest area of impact. This sets up the team for success.
