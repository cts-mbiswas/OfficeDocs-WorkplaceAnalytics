# Manage subjects, feedback providers, and coaches in a Viva Glint 360 feedback program

>[!TIP]
> Although **Manage Subjects** shows on the 360 Program Summary page ahead of **Cycle Settings**, configure cycle settings before adding Subjects. Access the **Manage Subjects** section after choosing your cycle.

## Manual addition of 360 Subjects

Selecting Subjects can be done manually or through an upload, if you’re adding a large number of Subjects. 

1. Search for the employee’s name in **Add a Subject**. Begin to type an employee’s name.
2. Select it from the dropdown menu.
3. The Subject name now appears in the **Manage Subjects** box.

## Bulk addition of Subjects and Coaches

1.	Select **Import Subjects**.
2.	In the window that displays, select **Download CSV**. [Read about CSV export and import here](/viva/glint/setup/360-export-import).
3.	Populate the .csv file with Subject unique IDs and email addresses and then add the names by selecting **Upload**.

>[!NOTE]
> Coach assignment is optional, and selection is up to your organization. Managers are often coaches but don’t have to be. Coaches guide Subjects though their 360 report and are automatically granted report access.

## Select 360 feedback providers

Generally, allow the 360 Subject to select and review their own feedback providers as part of the 360 process. As an admin, however, you can select feedback providers on a Subject’s behalf.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If 360s are being run for senior execs, prepopulated feedback providers are automatically invited.

1. Select the **ellipses next to the Subject name** and then choose **Edit/Add Feedback Providers**.
2. Choose the appropriate feedback providers and then select **Invite Feedback Providers when cycle is live**. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Emails are configured in the **Communications** setup for the cycle. That email is where Subjects see what tasks are left for them to complete their 360.

## Using the prepopulated Feedback Providers setting for senior leaders

In the Subject ellipses menu: 

1.	Select **Edit/Add feedback providers**. 
1.	Select **Invite feedback providers when Cycle is Live**. 

    Once selections are saved and the cycle is live, feedback providers receive an invitation to participate. The Subject can review and add other feedback providers during the cycle. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Employees, other than the Subject, may be added to any feedback provider category but can’t be added to multiple feedback provider categories for a single subject.

## Add a coach

1. Select the ellipses next to the Subject name.
2. Select **Edit/Add Coach.**
3. Search for the coach's name using the search bar and select **Add Coach**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The role of coach is optional and the 360 program can proceed without it.
