# Viva Glint 360 admin live cycle management 

Microsoft Viva Glint 360 admins have access to dashboards and settings during live 360 cycles. During live cycles, admins can track responses and edit items related to feedback providers, survey questions, competencies, schedule, and communications.

## 360 admin dashboard

During a live 360 cycle, the admin dashboard shows:

- The number of subjects yet to invite feedback providers
- The average number of feedback providers for each subject
- The number of subjects who need to complete their self-assessment
- The number and percentage of subjects who aren't eligible for a 360 report yet
- A list of live subjects
- A list of completed subjects
- A list of opted out subjects

### Filter to a live subject

When an admin filters to a subject with a live 360 cycle, they see:

- How many feedback providers are invited
- If a self-assessment is complete
- How many feedback providers meet the confidentiality threshold
- The cycle end date

## Download self-assessment and feedback provider response rate 

During a live 360 cycle, an admin can check on the self-assessment and feeedback provide response rate for participants and download this information to a CSV file.
