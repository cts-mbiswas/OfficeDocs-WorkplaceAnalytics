# Request identification of a Microsoft Viva Glint survey taker in Extreme Circumstances

If your organization determines that Extreme Circumstances exist, you can identify a survey taker even if export of raw survey responses is disabled. [Learn more about raw survey responses](/viva/glint/setup/employee-raw-data-export).

Extreme Circumstances exist if your organization determines that disclosure of a survey taker’s identity is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding: 

- illegal activities
- suspected fraud
- situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of a person
- to otherwise comply with the law

Your organization is solely responsible for determining whether Extreme Circumstances exist. Microsoft does not independently evaluate Extreme Circumstances disclosure requests. If your organization attests that Extreme Circumstances exist, Microsoft provides the requested identity of the survey taker.

## How to request identity disclosure in Extreme Circumstances 

To request disclosure in Extreme Circumstances, the Viva Glint Admin must submit a support ticket through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, including “extreme circumstance” as a subject. For detailed instructions on submitting a support ticket, see [Get support for Viva Glint](/viva/troubleshoot/glint/contact-support/get-support-viva-glint).

When a support agent reveives the ticket, they acknowledge the request and request customer attestation that Extreme Circumstances exist. 

In order for the support agent to fulfill the request, provide the following information:
- Customer UUID
- Survey Program Name
- Survey Cycle Start Date
- The verbatim text of the survey comments giving rise to the request

In less than 24 hours, the support agent provides the requested survey taker’s email address in response to the submitted ticket.
