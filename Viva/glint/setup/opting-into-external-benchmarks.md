# Opt into Viva Glint external benchmarks

Viva Glint admins can opt into - *give consent to use* - external benchmarks. After doing so, they can select one or more of these benchmarks for managers to use when viewing reports.

## Why use the external benchmark?

**For an initial survey**, when no historical data exists, most organizations are interested in seeing how their scores compare to an external benchmark, to begin orienting themselves to their results. The external benchmark is useful for company admins to provide a meaningful reference point in assessing an organization's overall scores. 

External benchmarks are helpful initially, but as you begin to survey more frequently, trends and internal comparisons become more useful for making incremental improvements. 

> [!TIP]
> Use [Viva Glint's global benchmark offerings and methodology](/viva/glint/setup/benchmarks) for external benchmarking comparisons.

## Give consent to external benchmarks so managers can use them to view reports

If consent is **Off**, external benchmark selection is not possible.
If consent is **On**, there needs to be at least one ext benchmark selected to be able to save the setting. 

>[!TIP]
>There can't be a scenario where consent toggle is Off and an external benchmark is selected, or a scenario where consent toggle is saved as On and no external benchmarks were selected.

- Global
