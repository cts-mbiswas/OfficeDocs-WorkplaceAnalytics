# Change survey item IDs for expired survey cycles

Comparing survey trend is essential to tracking focus area progress – overall employee engagement - over time. You can still use item data from a retired survey as a comparison in a new survey which uses the identical item. You need to change the item ID. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The term "survey item" refers to any *question* or *statement* posed to a survey taker. 

## Viewing the survey item ID

You need to know if any items from an expired survey are being used and then compare their IDs.

There are two ways to view an item ID:

### View the item ID from the Question Library

From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Question Library**.

### View the Item ID from the Questions page 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs**.
2. Within the survey cycle, in the **Program Summary** section, navigate to the **Questions** page.
3. Select the question row to reveal the **Edit Question** slider window.
4. You see the **Question ID** toward the top of the panel. The ID applies to all active, upcoming, and completed surveys.

## Edit an expired ID to use in an upcoming cycle

When changing a Question ID, you chose a question from the survey program that you want to use instead of it. Question IDs aren't editable for active surveys.

> [!CAUTION]
> Change an ID only if you’ve discovered that survey trends are broken -  the items are identical, but the IDs are not. 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs**.
1. Select the **Completed surveys** tab and then the survey. Be sure the survey status shows *Completed*.
1. Now select **Survey Questions.**
1. On the **Questions** page, hover over an item row to reveal the ellipses. Select **Change Question ID.**

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If your survey items are translated into different languages, export the survey details before proceeding, so there is a record of your translations.

1. The **Change Question ID** dialog box displays.
