# Change survey item IDs for expired survey cycles

Comparing survey trend is essential to tracking focus area progress – overall employee engagement - over time. When a survey is retired, you can still use the data for an item from that survey as a comparison in a new survey which uses the identical item by changing the item ID. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The term "survey item" refers to any *question* or *statement* posed to a survey taker. 

## Viewing the survey item ID

You need to know if any items from an expired survey are still being used and then compare their IDs.

There are two ways to view an item ID:

### From the Question Library feature**

From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Question Library**.

### Item ID can also be seen on the Questions page 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs**.
2. Within the survey cycle, navigate to the **Questions** page in *Program Summary*. Select **Edit Question** and a slider window opens.
3. You see the **Question ID** above the *Language* section. This ID applies to all active, upcoming, and completed surveys. 

## Editing an expired ID for use in an upcoming cycle

> [!NOTE]
> The Question ID isn't editable for active surveys.

> [!CAUTION]
> Change an ID only if you’ve discovered that survey trends are broken -  the items are identical, but the IDs are not. 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs**.
1. Select the **Completed surveys** tab and then **Questions** in the **Program Summary** section.
1. On the **Questions** page, select a question to open the **Edit Question** panel.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If your survey items are translated into different languages, export the survey details before proceeding, so you’ll have a record of your translations.

4. Be sure the **Current question type, name and ID** are as expected.
1. Choose an item from the survey program that you want to use from the dropdown box.
1. Select **Change** to commit your selection. 
1. Select **Save Changes**. 
1. After these steps are complete, you see a **Changes Pending** notification on the item line. 
1. Select **Save**.
