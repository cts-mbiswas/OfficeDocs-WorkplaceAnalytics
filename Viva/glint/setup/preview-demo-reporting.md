# Preview pre-launch demo data in Viva Glint reporting

How do your employee attributes and potential survey responses look in Microsoft Viva Glint reporting? Previewing demo data enables Viva Glint Administrators to familiarize themselves with the Viva Glint dashboard. Previewing reporting also enables an understanding of how data file attributes appear in reporting scenarios. 

Demo surveys are available for Recurring and Ad-Hoc survey types only.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Demo dashboards last for seven days only. Follow report preview steps again to regenerate preview reports.

> [!CAUTION]
> Demo preview generation is limited to 3 times/day/program/user. Report generation requests queue up in the order that they’re requested across all surveys and users.

## Can I generate a new demo data report preview after editing a survey?

To **replace** a generated report, preview with newly uploaded employee attributes. A dialog tells you that a report preview was previously generated. To replace this demo report with a new version, select **Generate Report Preview**. The seven-day report visibility starts over with the generation of the new report.

## How long does a preview take to generate?

Generally, preview reports for surveys with ~25 questions and 5,000 employees or fewer generate almost immediately. Surveys with several questions and for organizations with more than 50,000 users can take up to 24 hours to generate.

## How do I see my demo report after it's generated?

**From your Viva Glint dashboard:**

1. If Select **Reports.**
2. Choose **Demo Data for `<survey name>`**.
3. Select the report to review.

**Your demo report is also viewable from the program listing on your admin dashboard.** It shows in the list of your programs with the name of the program preceeded by "Demo Data." To leave that program - and remove the demo banner from the top of your screen - use **Switch Program.**

## What does demo data reporting include?

Commonly asked questions about demo data dashboards:

### Is preview reporting generated for a survey with question targeting?

Demo data can't be generated for surveys with question targeting or excluded Distribution Lists. To generate a preview from a survey with targeting:
- Deselect the targeted item from the cycle/program, or
- Temporarily remove targeting from the item while the preview generates

### Does the demo preview show Strengths and Opportunities? 

No. Demo data previews rely on fake response data with little variation in scores that doesn’t produce Strengths and Opportunities. 

As a potential workaround, an Admin can filter to a manager team with at least ~20-30 respondents to view a cut of data with more score variance than the company-wide data, but it's trial and error.

### Does the demo preview use items selected for the upcoming cycle or all items that exist at the program level? 

The preview uses all items that are part of the next scheduled survey cycle.

## Should I create Focus Areas from demo preview dashboards? 

Don't create fake focus areas as they then show with other real Focus Areas. If you do create them as a training exercise, delete them afterward.
