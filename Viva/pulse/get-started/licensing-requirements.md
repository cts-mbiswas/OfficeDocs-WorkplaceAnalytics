Viva Pulse is available both as a premium experience and a limited experience available with Microsoft 365 Copilot subsciption. The following list of capabilities are available to Pulse authors and Adminstrators as part of these experiences. 

| Capability | Premium experience | Limited experience |

To send a Pulse request with full premium experience, you must have a license to one of the following:

1. **Viva Suite**: Users with a Viva Suite subscription license have access to all applications that are part of the Viva Suite, including Viva Pulse. To learn more about the Viva apps within the Viva Suite, visit [Employee experience and engagement in Microsoft Viva](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva).
2. **Viva Workplace Analytics and Employee Feedback**: Users with a Viva Workplace Analytics and Employee Feedback subscription license have access to Viva Pulse, Viva Insights, and Viva Glint. To learn more about Workplace Analytics and Employee Feedback, visit [Workplace Analytics and Employee Feedback](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/workplace-analytics-and-feedback).
3. **Viva Pulse Admin-led Trial**: The Viva Pulse Admin-led Trial allows Billing Admins to assign 25 users within their tenant to try Viva Pulse for 30 days. During the 30 days, users can use the full functionality of Viva Pulse. Please contact your field seller or account executive to set up your own trial.

To send a Pulse request using the limited experience that's available with Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions, you must have a license to a valid Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription. If the user has both a Microsoft 365 Copilot and Viva Pulse license assigned to them, in that case they have access to all the premium capabilities to Pulse based on their Azure Active Directory (AAD) role. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are trying to access Viva Pulse with your Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription, please visit the [Viva Pulse home page](https://pulse.cloud.microsoft). If you have any trouble or see the No Access error, please retry in a few minutes. If you continue to face issues loading the Viva Pulse home page, reach out to your account team or Microsoft support team and log an incident with us.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Additionally, a user must have an active license to Microsoft Forms to create and send a Pulse request. A user does not need a license to respond to a Pulse request.
