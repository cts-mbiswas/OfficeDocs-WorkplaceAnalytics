# Using web parts to display content on your SharePoint site

Use the News, Viva Engage, File and Media, and Highlighted content web parts and Video pages to display content, videos, and files from sources across SharePoint, Viva Engage, and Stream (on SharePoint) to keep users informed and engaged with news posts, conversations, and video feeds.

Each user’s experience will look different because content displayed in the web parts is personalized to the viewer based on the SharePoint sites and Viva Engage communities that they follow. The tools described in this article are a good way to surface content on your SharePoint site like how the Feed in Viva Connections distributes information.

For more information on how content is displayed, see the section in this article on [where content in the Feed comes from](/viva/connections/faqs-viva-connections-feed#where-does-content-in-the-feed-come-from).

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need site member permissions (or higher) to add and edit web parts to a SharePoint site.

## Display news posts with the News web part

Keep users in the loop and engage your audience with important or interesting stories by using the [News web part](https://support.microsoft.com/c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165) on your page or site to display a collection of news posts from various SharePoint sources.

Create eye-catching posts like announcements, organizational news, people news, status updates, and more that can include graphics and rich formatting. [Boost news posts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/46ad8dc5-8f3b-4d81-853d-8bbbdd0f9c83) so it appears in a prominent position to be seen by your organization. You can also customize the web part to change the layout, order of appearance, or target posts to specific audiences.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Boosted news will display for us to 4 days in the News web part.

## Feature videos hosted on a SharePoint site and Microsoft Stream
