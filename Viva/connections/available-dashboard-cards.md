# Available dashboard cards in Viva Connections

The Viva Connections dashboard uses dynamic cards that can be [targeted to specific users](create-dashboard.md#apply-audience-targeting-to-cards) to help them perform tasks like clock in for a shift, access training materials or links to department resources, look up contact information, manage assigned tasks, and more. If your organization has a specific task in mind, you can also use the [card designer](use-card-designer.md) to quickly build "custom" cards using a template, without the need for custom code.

## Edit the dashboard

You need member or owner level permissions to access the card designer from the dashboard card toolbox. See the article on [creating a Viva Connections dashboard and adding cards](create-dashboard.md#edit-the-dashboard-from-microsoft-teams) for information on getting started.

## Available dashboard cards

### Add a partner card or Microsoft app

The Viva Connections dashboard and mobile experience can be extended and customized using cards, which are based on [adaptive cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) and the [SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview). These adaptive cards are used to display data, complete tasks, and connect to Teams Apps, Websites, and mobile apps on Viva Connections. They provide a low-code solution to bring your line-of-business apps into the dashboard.

To create custom experiences on Viva Connections dashboard and Viva Connections Mobile App, developers must use the SPFx to create custom Adaptive Card Extensions (ACE). To learn more about creating ACE, see the following tutorial: [Build your first SharePoint Adaptive Card Extension](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/get-started/build-first-sharepoint-adaptive-card-extension). Learn more about [Viva Connections extensibility.](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/overview-viva-connections)

#### Add a partner card

There are three ways to get partner apps and solutions integrated with the Viva Connections dashboard. The following image shows an example of a partner card.

![Screenshot of a partner card.](../media/connections/partner-card-example.png)

##### Option 1: Discover and request apps from the Viva Connections card toolbox

Partner cards and an entry point to browse more cards in the app store will automatically display in the card toolbox. Depending on your level of permissions, you might need to request the app before it can be used on the dashboard. [Learn more about managing partner apps](/sharepoint/use-app-catalog).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Site owners managing the Viva Connections dashboard will need to request partner apps before they are available in the card toolbox.
> - Some partner apps require a service plan agreement with your organization.

##### Option 2: Acquire the app from a Microsoft AppSource or the SharePoint store

- If you're building a dashboard, you can [request the app directly](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/explore-and-deploy-sharepoint-framework-solutions-from-partners/ba-p/2645289), but you need approval from an admin of the tenant-level app catalog to continue with the installation
- If you're an **admin** of a tenant-level app catalog, you can deploy business apps directly.
You can acquire apps from non-Microsoft developers by browsing the [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=sharepoint) or [SharePoint store](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/explore-and-deploy-sharepoint-framework-solutions-from-partners/ba-p/2645289) (recommended).

[Get step-by-step guidance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/explore-and-deploy-sharepoint-framework-solutions-from-partners/ba-p/2645289) on how to request and deploy an app, and add an app to your site. For tenant admin, [learn how to manage apps](/sharepoint/use-app-catalog#work-with-sharepoint-store-apps) in the App Catalog.

##### Option 3: Acquire the app directly from the partner developer

 > [!NOTE]
 > SharePoint administrative permissions are required to complete this task.

You can request apps directly from the Viva Connections partner developers and partners. Admin permissions are required to [add the app to tenant level app catalog.](/sharepoint/use-app-catalog)

### Add the Viva Topics card

Topics has two different cards. The **Topics Contribute card** can be used to reach people who are known knowledge managers and are already engaged with topics and knowledge areas. Topics and knowledge areas are dynamically displayed in the card based on the viewers interests, current projects, and expertise. The **Topics Discover card** can be used to view topics and knowledge areas for people who could be interested in learning more or contributing to a topic.

[Learn more about the two different cards](/microsoft-365/topics/topics-card-viva-connections).

The [Viva Learning](/viva/learning/overview-viva-learning) card provides users quick-links to recommended trainings, and can be set to target specific trainings to certain individuals. Users can easily access their required trainings by selecting the Viva Learning link.

Content in the cards is dynamic and changes according to settings in Viva Learning. The following are three examples of Viva Learning card states that display different information depending on the viewer and Viva Learning settings.

   ![Screenshot of the Viva Learning property pane.](../media/connections/create-dashboard/viva-learning-card-settings.png)

4. To target your card to specific audiences (that is, the card only displays in the dashboard to the audience you specify), select one or more groups to target. For more information on audience targeting, see [Audience targeting](create-dashboard.md#apply-audience-targeting-to-cards).

### Add the Viva Pulse card

Invite managers and team leads to send requests for feedback or view feedback results using the [Viva Pulse](/viva/pulse/introduction-to-viva-pulse) card. The card provides a way for feedback authors to access and interact with active or recently closed feedback pulses. This provides feedback authors and feedback providers with a direct link to their account in the Viva Pulse Teams app.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Itâ€™s recommended admins set up the Viva Pulse app for their organization and pin it as an app in Microsoft Teams so users can fully experience the Viva Pulse card. For more information, see the article on [manage, install, and pin Viva Pulse in the Teams admin center](/viva/pulse/setup-admin-access/manage-install-pin-viva-pulse-in-teams-admin-center).
> - Users will only see the Viva Pulse card if their organization is licensed for Viva Pulse.

Content in the card is dynamic and changes according to the [users role](/viva/pulse/introduction-to-viva-pulse#roles) in Viva Pulse and if a feedback pulse is active. The following are examples of Viva Pulse card states that display different information depending on the viewerâ€™s role and if any active or recently closed feedback pulses are available.

The Pulse card tells feedback authors the number of responses an active or recently closed pulse received and provides a link to feedback results in their Viva Pulse account for the recently closed pulse. When multiple feedback results are available, authors are directed to their **Pulses sent** tab within the Viva Pulse Teams app.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/pulse-card-author-closed-state.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing two states of the Viva Pulse card.":::

When no open pulses are available, the card displays **send a pulse**, which brings the author to the Viva Pulse Teams app where they can create a new request for feedback to be sent out.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/pulse-card-author-send-pulse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the send a pulse state of the Viva Pulse card.":::

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Viva Pulse requires a license to send pulse requests for feedback and to review results. A license is **not required** to respond to a pulse. For more information on Viva Pulse licensing, see the article on [Licensing requirements](/viva/pulse/get-started/licensing-requirements).
> - The Viva Pulse card requires the Viva Pulse app to be enabled in Microsoft Teams for the card to display information
