# Setup requirements for Viva Engage in Native Mode for Microsoft 365

## Requirements 

Native Mode has the following requirements:

- There can only be one Viva Engage network on the tenant.

- All domains on the tenant are associated with the Viva Engage network, and there are no domains on the Viva Engage network that aren't on the tenant.

- All Viva Engage files must be [stored in SharePoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2111253).

- Retention mode in Viva Engage is set to Archive.

- All users must be in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID enforces Microsoft 365 identity. Any users who aren't mapped to the network must be deleted.

- There can't be any unlisted private groups.

- All existing groups must be Microsoft 365 connected.

- There can't be any external groups. Support for external groups is planned but isn't available with the initial release of Native Mode.

- There can't be any network-level or thread-level guests.

 > [!NOTE]
> Native Mode is strongly recommended for reasons of security, compliance, and Microsoft 365 integration.

## How does the Native Mode Alignment tool work with your network?

The Tool prepares your network for Native Mode by disabling some features and mitigating previously created instances of those features. Those changes include:

- Any unlisted private groups in your network are changed to private listed groups. Users are unable to create unlisted private groups.

- External groups in Viva Engage aren't supported. All external groups are made internal only, and guests in those groups no longer have access to the group and its contents. Support for B2B-based external groups is expected at a later date.

- Adds the Microsoft 365 Global administrator to unconnected groups that either have no owner, or the owner has no permissions to create Microsoft 365 groups. It doesn't add them to unconnected groups if the owner has group creation rights.

- Connects all unconnected Viva Engage groups after applying the changes mentioned in the previous three bulleted items.

- Prevents files from being uploaded in Viva Engage Private messages, and deletes all files previously uploaded in Viva Engage Private messages.

- Deletes all internal users (and their associated files and Private messages) in the network who aren't mapped to a Microsoft 365 identity in Microsoft Entra ID.

- Disables support for guests in the network, and removes existing guests from the network, along with their associated Private messages and files.

- Disables support for adding guests to an individual thread. Guests who were previously added to individual threads no longer have access.

- Deletes all group messages and files for previously deleted groups. Group messages are deleted consistent with your network's retention policy.

- Locks your network into Native Mode.

- Begins ingesting your data into the Security & Microsoft Purview compliance portal to support eDiscovery.

>[!CAUTION]
> Once you start alignment through the Tool, the change is **irreversible**.
> Notify users about the preceding changes *before* you run the Alignment Tool to make sure they're prepared.

## While the tool is running

- Unconnected groups don't receive Group updates.
