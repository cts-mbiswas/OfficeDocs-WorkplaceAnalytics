## Customize the Viva Engage header for network guests
<a name="VivaEngageHeader"> </a>

Use the network colors and network logo settings to change the header for users who sign in without a Microsoft 365 account.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization uses Microsoft 365, Microsoft 365 users won't see these changes.

1. In the Viva Engage admin center, select **Design**.
    
    Under **Select Network Colors**, pick a background color, or enter color hex codes for the **Header Background Color** and the **Header Text Color (Desktop App only)**. 

    Choosing a custom color for your header text applies only to the desktop application. On the web, text color is automatically selected (either black or white) based on the color of the header background. 
    
2. In the **Customize Network Header and Logo** section, select the files to use. Select a 40 pixels x 160 pixels file to use for the network logo, and a 56 pixels x 1200 pixels file to use as the background image in the header. 
    
## Set the logo for email notifications Viva Engage sends users
<a name="NotificationLogo"> </a>

1. In the Viva Engage admin center, select **Design**.
    
2. Under **Select Logo for Viva Engage Emails**, select a file that is 50 pixels x 1160 pixels.
    
## FAQ

**Q: Why don't I see changes made to network colors or logo?**

A: These settings in the Viva Engage admin center only apply to users who aren't signed in to Microsoft 365. If your organization is using Microsoft 365, only network guests see these changes. 

Microsoft 365 users see the Microsoft theme for the organization. To customize this theme, see [Customize the Microsoft 365 theme for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/8275da91-7a48-4591-94ab-3123a3f79530).
